# coverLetter
an Arduino sketch that plays back letter on an LCD 16x2 screen
things needed for this project
  1 x Arduino 
  1 x LCD 16x2 
  1 x Green LED
  1 x 300 ohm Resistor
  1 x 220 ohm Resistor
  2 x Pushbuttons
  
 This code can run on a standard Arduino Uno R3. You can substitute your own text into the coverLetter string.
 
 The only hand tweeking you may need to do is check for words that are longer than 16 chars, and set the numLines to fit your
 spefic string length. 
 
 Enjoy, Would love to see tweeks to this!
 
 Future Ideas: 
  Analog sensor to ad variablity to playback speed
  two more button for ud and down scrubing
